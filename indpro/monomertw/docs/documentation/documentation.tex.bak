\begin{abstract}
There were a variety of ideas and goals pursued during the course of this project.  First and formost was an overriding goal of pulling the problem away from the system that it ran on.  Previous implementations were dependent upon a certain architecure, and thus the system defined the problem size.  This would need to change, the problem must become independent of the architecture.  To do this, a variety of things were looked at.  First we contemplated rewriting the intital work done on synchronous relaxation (SR).  This accomplished it's goal of making the problem size independent of the architecture.  However, there were still bottlenecks inherent in the system, so the use of Time Warp (TW) was stuidied.  This also should accomplish the goal of making the problem size independent of the underlying architecture.  Also discussed have been the use of logical processes and hybrid OpenMP/MPI mechinisms.
