This is a repo full of my class work from my undergraduate 
and graduate level computer science course work at BGSU. 
I haven't removed any documents from the file tree, and 
many haven't been touched since the course ended oh so
many years ago.

Files are organized by class, in directories labeled with
the BGSU course number.  I know some course numbers have 
changed, and the entire course number format has changed
since I took a vast majority of these classes, so if 
you're trying to cheat in CS0301, well, I guess you need
to know what it was called when I took it.  Natch.

As far as I know I've got IP ownership on these files, 
so I'm just going to treat them all the same.  Any file
which I recieved with a copyright notice would still 
contain that intact, so I'm just going to ignore safety
and say, this is a copyright FFA.  If you do use 
something, some attribution would be nice.

Anyway, I doubt you're still reading this so, enjoy!
