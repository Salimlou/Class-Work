Parallel Computers & Networks

    One of the largest problems facing a designer of a parallel computing cluster is to use either a static network or a dynamic network based 
around personal computer clustering.  The static network I would like to contrast against the PC clustering is a mesh network.  A mesh network is 
probally the most versitile network in terms of embedding and routing and therefore most likly the best contender to a PC cluster network.

    The topology of a static mesh network is this; each node is connected to 4 (2d topology) other nodes.  The links between nodes are usually 
bi-directional so that each node can send/recieve messages from each of the other nodes it is connected to.  There could be variances in the 
mesh topology where the so-called end nodes, nodes con the edges of the mesh, are connected therefor forming rings on the rows and columns of the 
mesh.  Also you could connect the nodes of the mesh in 6 directions or 8 directions using a 3d or 4d topology.

    Also the toplogy of the static mesh network allows for various other types of static networks to be easily embeded into the mesh.  One such 
example would be a tree network embeded into a 2d mesh.  Each node of the tree would get mapped to a node in the mesh, in a standard way, therefor 
allowing a user to exploit the power of a tree network while using a mesh networked computer.  As mentioned above you can have variations of a mesh 
network.  This is logically true that these variations are just 1d, 3d, and 4d varaitions of the mesh network, but they are concidered to be their 
own type of network and are usually embeded in a 2d mesh network.

    The routing of a static network is usually very easy.  Since the network is static you are able to exploit the fixed nodes and ususally routing 
can be handled with a bitwise operation or a simple function.  A static network usually allows for very little network overhead.  Also a static 
network allows you to use a type of routing called wormhole routing.  Wormhole routing is where you divide the message into very small packages 
called flits.  By using flits you can reduce the amount of storage at each node and also reduces latencey regardless of path lenght.  This last 
feature is very important.  Latency is the time it takes one part of the message to get from point A to point B.  This is important because latency 
can kill the performance of algorithims that need to communicate with other nodes in the network before processing their data.

    Traditional routing is called store-and-forward routing.  The entire message is recieved before the message is sent to the next network.  This 
is also called packet-switching.  Packet-switching in the best case is linerally related to the distance between the sending and recieving nodes.  
However there is another type of switching called circut-switching.  Circut-switching creates a virtual circut between two nodes that all subsequent 
packets follow.  Esentally circut-switching has constant latency despite the distance between nodes.  The same holds true for wormhole routing.  
Wormhole routing is approximatly constant despite the lenght between nodes because a flit is such a small piece of the entire message and is 
proportional to the amount of bandwidth between nodes.

    Static networks, especially thoes with adaptive routing algorithims, are very suceptable to two conditions.  The first condition is called 
livelock.  This is a condition where a packet continually gets passed around a network without ever finding it's intended node.  Livelock is usually 
a problem with an adaptive routing, where it's adaption prevents the packet from every getting to the host due to network usage or some other 
factor.  The other condition, deadlock, plagues all types of static network routing.  A deadlock occurs when a node wants to send a message to 
aother node, who wants to send a message to a 3rd node and so on till each node is waiting for each other node to send a message, but no node is 
ever able to send a message.  A deadlock condition is usually aleviated by using virtual channnels over the physical hardware.  Each virtual channel 
has it's own send/recieve buffer.  The virtual channels would be multiplexed across the physical link between nodes.  This aleviates the deadlock 
problem by keeping the hardware from deadlocking therefor alowing the nodes to still communicate even if one of the virtual channels are deadlocked.

   To contrast a static mesh network I will use a dynamic cluster.  A cluster is a group of usually commody personal computers networked using 
common network equiptment.  The most common network equiptment is Ethernet, as it's widly avaliable and has decent bandwidth for high speed packet 
switching.  There are other netwoks types, such as token ring, but these are less common, and have been phased out in past years.  I will contrast 
using a Ethernet type network of workstations.  Each workstation will only have one network interface controller (NIC) card and therefore only one 
physical link to the network.

   The topology of a cluster is usually that of the network hardware.  A Ethernet network is based upon the principal of a single wire connection 
all the computer.  Each NIC must wait for the line to clear before sending it's message across the wire.  A Ethernet network in avaliable in a 
variety of speeds.  The most common speeds are 10Mbps (approx. 1280KBps peak transfer) and 100Mbps (approx. 12800KBps peak transfer).  Ethernet 
hardware is also avaliable in 1000Mbps (Gigabit, approx. 128000KBps peak transfer).  The most comment Ethernet network in modern clusters is Gigabit 
Ethernet.

   Since Ethernet is assumed to have only one wire there exists some special problems with transmitting data at high rates of speed.  Since there is 
only one wire, you run the risk of two NICs trying to send a data packet (called a frame) on the wire at the same time.  This condition is called a 
collision.  If a collision occurs each packet must be resent correctly, since in the collision the data was mangled beyond recovery.  Most Ethernet 
networks aleviate this problem by using either smart switches or routers to connect the machines to each other.  A smart switch esentally allows 
multiple computers to broadcast frames at the same moment, but advoiding collision because the wire is broken into smaller segments.  The switch 
then handles the transmission of the frames to the other nodes connected to the switch.  A router works by striping the headers from the frame and 
passing the frames along to the right part of the network.  A router could isolate parts of the network from other parts of the network, therefore 
removing the risk of collision.

   One of the limiting factors of a Ethernet based cluster is the latency across the network.  On adverage a Ethernet has a latency of 500 
nanoseconds (Wilkinson, 1999).  Also a cluster has significant overhead in the message passing software that is needed on each node.  Most all 
clusters are based upon a message passing interface (MPI) between nodes.  This can create conciderable network traffic, which is why the large 
transfer rates capable with Gigabit Ethernet are desirable.  However if the Ethernet network is well designed with a approiate number of hardware 
routers and a lack of hubs (hubs are dumb devices, they esentally repeat the frame across all connected wires) the latency and delay associated with 
a Ethernet network can be kept to a minimum.

   One benefit of a cluster over a static network is flexiability.  A cluster allows for the adaptation of the logical topology of the nodes.  In a 
static network your nodes are fixed in their topology.  In a cluster you can have a hardware network topology independed of the logical (presented 
to the programmer) topology.  This allows for the programmer to adapt his algorithim to the topology that best fits the problem instead of adapting 
it to the topology of the network.  It would be this flexiability that allows clusters to exceede a static networked parallel computer.

   As you can see there are many difference between a networked cluster and a static network parallel computer.  Each has it's own benefits and each 
it's own drawbacks.  As powerful, cheap hardware becomes predominate in our world, you will begine to see a glut of networked clusters instead of 
static network parallel computers.  This is manly due to advances in hardware speeds for the interconnection networks and the cost of the machines 
used in the cluster.  Also the flexiability that a cluster provides over a static network allows the cluster to adapt to new and never-before-seen 
problems.
